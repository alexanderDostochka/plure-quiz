# Quiz Landing page

DEMO [https://alexanderdostochka.github.io/plure-quiz/]

**Objective:** In this test assignment, youâ€™re required to create a Trivia/Quiz landing page on any
topic of your choice, using native front development including HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
without relying on external libraries or frameworks like React.

# Idea
In order to increase the speed of the site, the idea came to create a Virtual DOM.
- Effective UI updates: Virtual DOM allows you to reduce the number of direct manipulations with the real DOM
- Structured code: Using the Virtual DOM allows you to structure your code by separating presentation logic (DOM manipulation) from business logic
- Optimization of rerendering: Virtual DOM allows you to effectively optimize the rerendering process by using various techniques such as node tree, diffuse update and change packaging
